This repository consists of my final project for ECE 385 - Digital
Systems Lab class at UIUC. We built Galaxian, a space shooter game
by Namco, on hardware using an FPGA on Altera DE2 board. We wrote
the game in SystemVerilog HDL and programmed the System-On-Chip 
memory in C for receiving inputs from a USB keyboard and displaying
the output on a VGA monitor in the original 224 x 288 pixel 
resolution. 

Please see "ECE385FinalProjectReport.pdf" for detailed reference.
